This project demonstrates a Windows 11 style GUI written in Python using Tkinter. It showcases labels, a scrollable area, buttons, a progress bar, and now lets you upload and arrange multiple sound files.

Use the **Add Files** button to select one or more `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, or `.ogg` files. The chosen files appear in a list where you can move them up or down or remove them entirely. A small progress bar and status label demonstrate additional GUI elements.

## Running
```bash
python3 main.py
```
